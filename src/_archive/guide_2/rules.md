FEDERAL BUREAU OF COHERENCE BRIEFING 
FOR EXPEDITION 14 INTO THE ZONE

The Zone took us by surprise. It all started with reports of anomalies in a sparsely populated town and the rural area around it.

Locals were calling in to talk radio with stories of impossible animal hybrids, eerily unseasonal weather, and plant species with unearthly properties. Their doctors detailed never-before-seen conditions. People disappeared. Others claimed to have spoken to long-dead loved ones.

We initiated special containment procedures. Performed tests. Experiments on the locals. Then, The Boundary appeared, and every person still living there was cut off from us. We don’t know if the locals are still alive. Or still human.

Since then, not a single expedition we’ve sent in has returned. Not. One.

We don’t know what The Zone wants——or if it wants——but it’s incredibly dangerous. It’s a mirror. It manifests whatever you bring into it. Fears. Obsessions. Memories. The Zone brings them to life to test you.

There are rumors that The Zone can grant your deepest wish if it deems you worthy. Sensor readings show something incredibly powerful at its heart. Perhaps the only way to make it out is to get all the way to the Center.

You are the 14th Expedition. You will almost certainly not return. Good hunting. But prepare to die. The Federal Bureau of Coherence, without admitting liability, thanks you for accepting this mission.
