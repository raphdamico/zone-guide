# Troubleshooting

### What if someone has to leave halfway through?
The Zone is designed so that it's safe to leave at any time (the door is always open!) You should never feel like you need to stay in a game longer than you'd like. 

Here's what to do if someone needs to leave.

* If someone leaves before or during the :camping::fire: **Campfire**, you can safely go back to the lobby and delete their character. This will remove them from the rotation.

* If a player needs to leave after that, there are a couple of known bugs which may break the game if you delete their character, so I would recommend just leaving them there and having other players claim their turn whenever it comes up. For any decisions that require that player, have someone go out to the lobby and login in as them (you can just keep another tab open with that player)


### I spotted a bug!

* If you spot a bug, please report it in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rZwM84p35C) in the #report-bugs channel. Feel free to @mention raphdamico so I get to it faster (I want to know if you're having a problem!)

* If you don't feel like going to the Discord, I'd still love to hear about it over email, at [raph@laughingkaiju.com](mailto://raph@laughingkaiju.com)


### My game is messed up!

* Oh no! The first thing to try is to go to the Game Lobby, click the `DEBUG` button and press `RESET TURN`
 
* If that doesn't work, the more nuclear option is to `RESET GAME`. This will preserve your characters but will reset everything else. This is a good idea if you're close to the start of the game.

* Note â€” the options in the debug view can break your game even further
