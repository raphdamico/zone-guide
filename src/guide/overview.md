# How to play scenes

Playing the game should feel like having a conversation where we invent the story together. Sometimes you’ll describe what’s happening, other times you may act it out.

### Role of the Director

During the game, we will take turns being the Director, who:

* Pulls the next Scene card and sets up the scene
* Breaks any ties during that scene
* Ends scenes (anyone can say “Cut” but the Director decides)

Once the director has set up the scene, play should return to a freeform conversation where everyone is building on each other’s ideas.

### To set up a scene:

* Wrap up loose ends from the previous scene. For example, if the players were in danger, did they escape or are they still in danger at the beginning of the next scene?

* Decide if you want to move to the next location. The Zone will not allow you to backtrack. Ever.

* Try to only move to a new location if at least a couple of Not So Easy cards have been played, or someone has met their Fate there.

### When you get to a new location
* Take a Scene card and read the prompt out loud. Pick another if you don’t feel inspired.

* Briefly frame the scene and begin narrating the story. If necessary, wrap up how you got here from the previous scene. If you’re feeling stuck, ask the group for ideas or try to answer the questions on the card!

::: warning Scene questions
Each scene card has optional questions on it under the main prompt. The first is intended to be a good question to help you set up the key element of the scene. The second is about the crux, the peak drama and something Not So Easy to overcome!

Sometimes this is something external, like a mutant, shambling beast with radioactive claws. Sometimes what’s not so easy is internal, like a character overcoming their need to keep something secret.

### To end the scene

* End the scene whenever the Scene prompt has been resolved. In the previous example, that’s when enough rumors had been shared about The Zone

*  It’s best to end the scene too early rather than too late. Don’t let it “wander” once the scene prompt has been resolved

* Anyone can call out to end the scene (they can say “Scene” or “Cut”), but the Director decides if the scene is ready to end.
The ritual. At the end of your turn as Director, pass the scene deck to the player on your left.
A tip for the Director: ask questions

::: warning Being the Director
The Director role can be feel scary at first—like you’ve just been put on the spot, or are suddenly the GM. Are you now responsible for the story?

Actually, you’re not! The director is not a GM. In fact, the best Directors are the ones who ask a lot of questions, which gives everyone a chance to be creative!

If you’re ever stuck, just turn the question in your head into a question for everyone.
