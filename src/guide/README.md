## Quick FAQ

### Who can do moves? Everyone!
Any player can use the moves at any time—not just the Director!

### The Director controls the Start & End of each scene
During the scene itself they should aim to facilitate: keep things moving, ask questions, act as a tiebreaker if needed.

### Aim for at least one NOT SO EASY per scene
(That's for the whole group, not one for each player)

### TAKE STOCK is a great way to set up a scene
During the scene, SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT is great for ratcheting up the action.

### How many scenes to do in each location?
If you want to keep the game closer to 2 hours, do one scene per location. Most groups do two or three scenes per location before the Boundary, then only one scene in each of the locations afterwards
